     <h1 class="title"> The 13th Pangasinan Tourism and Trade Expo opens as Pangasinan celebrates its 442nd Agew Na Pangasinan.</h1>
            <p><h1>LINGAYEN,Philippines - Governor Amado "Pogi" I leads the Pangasinan Provincial Government. On April 5, 2022, Espino III, the province of Pangasinan's 442nd founding anniversary, formally launched the 13th Pangasinan Tourism and Trade Expo at the Capitol Beachfront.</p></h1>
<br>

<p><h1>The province of Pangasinan is noted for being one of the top salt producers in the Philippines, with the word "asin" in its name. In his homily during the Misa na Pisasalamat held at the historic Sison Auditorium in Lingayen, Archbishop Socrates B. Villegas of the Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan underlined that this key commodity reflects the identity of Pangasinan and Pangasinenses.</p></h1>

<p><h1>"The salt of sacrifices preserved Pangasinan," Archbishop Villegas said. "Salt is a component of contracts, promises, and word of honor; our predecessors exchanged salt in agreement since salt does not change."</p></h1>
            
            <img src="image/expo1.jpg" alt="">
<p><h1>"Let us preserve what we have received from our forefathers, be responsible for future generations, add flavor to our tasteless and bland lives, and to stand and honor our word," Archbishop Villegas imparted to the guests present at the Sison Auditorium as he ended his homily.</p></h1>
<br>
<p><h1>After the Misa na Pisasalamat, Governor Espino was joined by Lingayen Mayor Leopoldo N. Bataoil, Board Members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, Provincial Government department heads and employees, and local tourism officers as they took part in a parade led by the University of Luzon Drum and Bugle Corps en route to the Capitol Beachfront where Fr. Yannix Liguid blessed the grounds of the 13th Pangasinan Tourism and Trade Expo.</p></h1>
